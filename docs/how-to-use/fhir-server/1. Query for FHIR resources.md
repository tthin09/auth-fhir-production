# FHIR REST API Standard

## Overview

This FHIR Server follows the FHIR REST API standard, allowing you to query for all resources using standard FHIR operations.

For complete FHIR REST API documentation, visit:
https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html

## Security Enabled
By default, this FHIR Server is protected by our ID Server. To query for any resources, we have to get an Access Token from ID Server and use that token in request's Authorization Bearer

To obtain an Access Token, check the document in `docs/how-to-use/id-server`

## Example Queries
```
# Get All Patients
GET /fhir/Patient
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Get Specific Patient by ID
GET /fhir/Patient/123
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Search Patients by Name
GET /fhir/Patient?name=John
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Get Patient's Observations
GET /fhir/Observation?patient=Patient/123
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Create New Patient
POST /fhir/Patient
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/fhir+json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "name": [{
    "family": "Doe",
    "given": ["John"]
  }]
}

# Update Patient

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
