# Audit Log Configuration

## Overview

The audit log feature is disabled by default but can be enabled through environment variable config.

## Enabling Audit Log

To enable audit logging, add the following variable to your .env file:

```
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true
```

If you're running all services on Docker compose, add this variable to your `docker-compose.yml` in `fhir-server` service:
```
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED: true
```

## Notes

- Server will log out all system events and user actions, we can check this in Terminal Log while server's running. Audit Log will capture all event in an `app.log` file
- The output will be in folder `fhir-server/logs`
- When `app.log` size exceed 20 MB, it will be archived to a separate file in format `app.yyyy-mm-dd.index.log`
