# Setup for Other Applications Integration

## Overview

Our ID Server treats external applications as clients. Each application requires proper client configuration for secure integration.

## Client Setup Process

### Step 1: Create a New Client

Navigate to ID Server admin console and create a new client:
- Client ID: unique identifier for the application
- Client Type: public (mobile/SPA) or confidential (server-side)
- Protocol: OpenID Connect

### Step 2: Configure Client URIs

Set up the following URI configurations:
- Root URL: Base URL of the client application
- Valid Redirect URIs: Allowed callback URLs after authentication
- Web Origins: Permitted domains for CORS requests
- Admin URL: Administrative callback URL (optional)

Example:

```
Root URL: https://patient-app.example.com
Valid Redirect URIs: https://patient-app.example.com/callback
Web Origins: https://patient-app.example.com
```

### Step 3: Client Authentication Setup

For confidential clients:
- Enable "Client Authentication"
- Generate client secret
- Configure client authentication method (client secret, JWT, etc.)

For public clients:
- Disable "Client authentication"
- Enable PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

### Step 4: Configure Client Scopes

Assign appropriate scopes based on application purpose:

- Patient Application: Search for `patient/` scopes and allow all scopes as optional
- Clinic Application: Search for `system/` scopes and allow all scopes as optional

## Note

- We can monitor client access patterns and audit logs in Event tabs
- Must implement proper redirect URI validation
- Use PKCE for public clients to prevent authorization code interception
